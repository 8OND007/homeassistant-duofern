# Protocol

Technical reference for the DuoFern serial protocol as implemented by this integration. See the [main README](../README.md) for installation and configuration, and [Supported Devices & Features](devices.md) for the entity/device reference.

---

- **Frame format**: Fixed 22-byte (44 hex char) frames over UART at 115200 baud
- **Init sequence**: 7-step handshake (Init1 → Init2 → SetDongle → Init3 → SetPairs → InitEnd → StatusBroadcast)
- **ACK-gated send queue**: One command in-flight at a time, 5-second timeout
- **Push-based updates**: Devices send status frames proactively; coordinator calls `async_set_updated_data()` on each received frame
- **Position convention**: DuoFern 0 = open / 100 = closed; HA 0 = closed / 100 = open (inverted transparently)
- **HSA (Heizkörperantrieb)**: Device-initiated bidirectional protocol - changes are queued and transmitted only when the device checks in with a status frame, matching FHEM's `%commandsHSA` / `HSAold` implementation
- **Boost frame layout** (OTA-verified via rtl_433):
  - ON: `f[8] = 0x40 | duration_min` (only if duration changed, else `0x00`), `f[11] = 0x03`; `sv` contains desired-temp only if it was changed, else `0x000000`
  - OFF: `f[8] = 0x00`, `f[11] = 0x02` (critical - `0x00` is silently ignored by the device)
- **Code-Pairing protocol** (OTA-verified via rtl_433):
  - USB frame byte 21 (flags) controls `pay[0]` in the radio frame: `0x00` = normal command, `0x01` = pairing mode
  - Sequence: SetPairs (0x03) → StartPair (0x04) → RemotePair ×2 (0x0D, flags=0x01) → wait for 0x06 response → StopPair (0x05)
  - The stick must be in pairing mode (StartPair) before sending the pair frame
  - `f[1]=0xFF` required for correct radio payload mapping (`pay[7]=FF`)
- **RolloTron obstacle detection** (status format `"21"`) — not in FHEM's `30_DUOFERN.pm` at all; FHEM's `%statusGroups{"21"}` has no obstacle/block field, and the word position Rohrmotor/SX5 use for it (word position 2) is already occupied here by `ventilatingPosition`/`ventilatingMode`. Derived from real device frames: word position 4, high byte, bit 7 (bit 15 of the 16-bit word) flips 0→1 when the device reports an obstacle. Confirmed against a single before/after frame pair from a RolloTron Comfort Master (`0x61`); no confirmed bit for blockage detection yet.

## Sniffing DuoFern Radio Frames (rtl_433)

To capture raw OTA frames with an RTL-SDR dongle (thanks a lot to gluap from pyduofern-hacs for writing down his command and pointing me to it):

```bash
rtl_433 -s 2.0M -f 434.5M -g 30 \
  -X "n=duofern,m=FSK_MC_ZEROBIT,s=10,r=100,preamble={10}fd4,invert" \
  -S known
```

Implementation based on `10_DUOFERNSTICK.pm` and `30_DUOFERN.pm` from the FHEM project.
